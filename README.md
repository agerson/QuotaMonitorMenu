# QuotaMonitorMenu
A Macintosh menu bar item for displaying the current free space of your home folder

The Situation: You have a Mac OS X Server with network home directories and disk quotas enabled. 

The Problem: The Mac OS Finder on client machines does not have very good support for warning users they are approaching their file quota limit. They end up all of sudden unable to save files with little or no explanation as to why.
 
The Solution: Quota Monitor Menu places the userâ€™s home folder quota status right in the menu bar. It will also pop up warnings at regular intervals. All warnings and text are customizable.
 
This is a general rewrite and cleanup of the code, and a few new preference options have been added. Tested on 10.6 and run in my organization for the last few weeks.
